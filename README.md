Word Guess Game Assignment
This is a basic word guessing game made using javascript.
The theme of my game is popular cocktails.
Users may begin by pressing any key and must guess the correct letters.
If a user guesses incorrectly 9 times, they lose.
If a user guesses the correct cocktail, they win.
